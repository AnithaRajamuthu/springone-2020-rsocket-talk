# Getting Started With RSocket

RSocket is pretty awesome. It’s a fully reactive, message-driven, multi-modal, bidirectional communication protocol built with microservices in mind. But sometimes, being awesome just isn’t enough! Sometimes you need practical, step-by-step []()instructions on how to get started the easy way, with no complicated docs to read or sample code to grok. In this talk, Ben will tell you everything you need to know to get started with RSocket and a few tips and tricks he picked up on his personal road to RSocket enlightenment.
